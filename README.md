# Proof-of-concept of using `content://` URI to access directories restricted in Android 11

Derived from [Android's ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE Sample](https://github.com/android/storage-samples/tree/main/ActionOpenDocumentTree).

With updated libs and modern code (as less deprecated and outdated as possible), may only work above API 24/25, though min API is still 21 in build.gradle. YMMV.
